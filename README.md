# Wyoming GLaDOS

[Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming) server for the [GLaDOS](https://github.com/R2D2FISH/glados-tts) text to speech system from R2D2FISH. It uses CUDA acceleration if supported.

The server part is an heavily stripped down version of [wyoming-piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-piper) and the gladostts folder is a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) of R2D2FISH's repo

TODOS: 
- Docker image ✅
- Automatic download of model files ✅ (please use download.py)
- Download from homeassistant directly (for homassistantos users)
- Readme steps for connecting this to homeassistant
- Add options to the docker container
- Code cleanup
- Speedup the tts engine for rtx gpus ? See [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt)
- PyPI package ?
