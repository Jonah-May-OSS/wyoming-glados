# Wyoming GLaDOS

[Wyoming protocol](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming) server for the [GLaDOS](https://github.com/R2D2FISH/glados-tts) text to speech system from R2D2FISH. It uses CUDA acceleration if supported.

The server part is a heavily stripped down version of [wyoming-piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-piper) and the gladostts folder is a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) of R2D2FISH's repo. It also leverages TensorRT for the vocoder model. This conversion happens the first time the server launches and requires roughly 5650 MB of VRAM. Once the .ts model file has been built, only about 575 MB should be used.

TODOS:
- Fix ARM64 builds so Docker images are created and published

## Usage

### Pre-requisites
1. Install and configure Docker
2. Install and configure the [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)

### Docker Compose (recommended)
For AMD64 with discrete GPUs:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  wyoming-glados:
    image: captnspdr/wyoming-glados:latest-amd64
    container_name: wyoming-glados
    ports:
      - 10201:10201
    volumes:
      - ./models:/usr/src/models:rw
    environment:
      - STREAMING=true
      - DEBUG=false
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```


### Docker (Latest tag on Docker Hub)
1. Clone this repository
2. Browse to the repository docker folder
3. Run the following command based on your platform:
   
For AMD64 with dGPU:

```bash
docker run \
  --gpus all \                                # expose all NVIDIA GPUs
  --name wyoming-glados \                     # give the container a name
  -d \                                        # run in detached mode
  -v "$(pwd)/models":/usr/src/models:rw \     # set directory to download model files to so they persist for easy container updates
  -p 10201:10201 \                            # map port 10201 â†’ 10201
  -e DEVICE=cuda \                            # `cuda` or `cpu`
  -e STREAMING=true \                         # Enable partial streaming
  captnspdr/wyoming-glados:latest-amd64
```
